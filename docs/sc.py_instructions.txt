Point tags/colors:
1 - Left front foot, yellow
2 - Right front foot, orange
3 - Left back foot, blue
4 - Right back foot, teal
5 - Gap start, pink
6 - Gap end, purple
7 - Snout/vent, red
8 - Centimeter, green

How it works:
Load up a directory of frames in cvmac.py as you normally would.
On any frame, put a snout/vent point(7) at the snout and the vent. Do the same thing with two centimeter points (8) to designate the length of a centimeter. Put a GS point (5) at the start of the gap and a GE (6) point at the end of the gap. You only need to do these things once.

Every time two feet land, pause and add the appropriate points for the feet that just landed (try to keep them on the same horizontal axis, and of course tag the same part of the foot every time). Try to tag the two feet that land per stride on the same frame. It might work if you don't do this, but I haven't tested it that way.

Once you have tagged all of the foot landings, the resulting points will be saved in a text file within the image directory you used. When you run sc.py, it will ask you for this text file. You can type in the path name or just drag the file to the terminal. Once you do this and press enter, the program runs and prints a list of the steps, as well as other numbers calculated.

The steps are printed in the terminal in (step, step length) format. 0 step is the first one that crosses the gap, length is relative to SVL.
Steps are also printed to a file in the directory now.  Terminal will tell you what the file is.
