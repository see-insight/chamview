Open CV
	Before doing anything, install Xcode:
	http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html
	And Macports:
	http://www.macports.org/install.php
	Update Macports:
	sudo port selfupdate
	In order for the python bindings to successfully install, a portfile must be modified.
	Navigate to the portfile's directory:
	cd /opt/local/var/macports/sources/rsync.macports.org/release/ports/graphics/opencv
	Edit it with something, I used pico:
	sudo pico portfile
	Delete entirely the line that reads:
	configure.args                  --without-python
	and replace it with
	configure.compiler              gcc-4.2
	Navigate back to your home directory and install python and opencv using Macports:
	(having other versions of python on your system may negatively affect your results)
	cd ~
	sudo port install python26
	sudo port install python_select
	sudo python_select python26
	sudo port install opencv
	Once all of this is done, load up the python, and type this as the first few lines of any script you 	plan on using opencv in:
	import sys
	sys.path.append('/opt/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/opencv')
	import cv
