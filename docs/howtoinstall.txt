Mac OS X:
	Open CV
	Before doing anything, install Xcode:
	http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html
	And Macports:
	http://www.macports.org/install.php
	Update Macports:
	sudo port selfupdate
	In order for the python bindings to successfully install, a portfile must be modified.
	Navigate to the portfile's directory:
	cd /opt/local/var/macports/sources/rsync.macports.org/release/ports/graphics/opencv
	Edit it with something, I used pico:
	sudo pico portfile
	Delete entirely the line that reads:
	configure.args                  --without-python
	and replace it with
	configure.compiler              gcc-4.2
	Navigate back to your home directory and install python and opencv using Macports:
	(having other versions of python on your system may negatively affect your results)
	cd ~
	sudo port install python26
	sudo port install python_select
	sudo python_select python26
	sudo port install opencv
	Once all of this is done, load up the python, and type this as the first few lines of any script you 	plan on using opencv in:
	import sys
	sys.path.append('/opt/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/opencv')
	import cv
	PIL
	Python imaging library is the only other dependency.  I used version 1.1.7, it is straightforward 		to download and install from the website 



Windows 7

	Note:  After you install opencv, python, and PIL, everything should work on windows except 	for the conversion of video to frame images.  This is due to a bug in the current version of 	opencv.  Once this bug is fixed, it should work fine.  

	Follow these steps in order:
Install 32-bit Python 2.7 (It is important to install the 32-bit version, even if you have 64-bit windows)
Install openCv (newest version, I used 2.2)
Install PIL 1.1.7 for python 2.7
Copy everything from C:\Opencv2.2\bin to C:\Python27\DLLS
copy everything from C:\opencv2.2\lib\site-packages to C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages
install numpy 1.5.1 for 32-bit windows and python 2.7
